# AdventureWorks Analytics Pipeline (Day 5 Hackathon Submission)

## Database Overview

The underlying data source is the **AdventureWorks** sample database, simulating a global bicycle manufacturing and sales company. The raw operational database is highly normalized (OLTP) and scattered across five domains: `Sales`, `Production`, `Purchasing`, `HumanResources`, and `Person`. While optimized for fast daily transactions, this raw structure is complex and slow for business intelligence reporting.

## Analytics Architecture

To bridge the gap between operational data and executive reporting, a **4-Layer Chained Analytical Pipeline** was engineered inside PostgreSQL.

* **Layer 1: Core Dimensions** – Flattens complex, multi-table relationships into single reusable lookups (e.g., merging `Product`, `Category`, and `Subcategory`).
* **Layer 2: Core Facts** – Merges transaction headers and detail lines, pre-calculating essential line-item mathematics (e.g., `linetotal`, `stockedqty`).
* **Layer 3: Analytical Aggregations** – Reusable intermediate views summarizing metrics by business entity (e.g., lifetime value by customer, overall performance by employee).
* **Layer 4: Executive KPI Datasets** – The final presentation layer. Fully dashboard-ready datasets built exclusively for direct querying by the Python visualization suite.

## Intermediate Tables Created

19 distinct analytical views were created within the `analytics` schema to prevent querying the operational tables repeatedly:

* **Dimensions (6)**: `dim_product`, `dim_customer`, `dim_territory`, `dim_employee`, `dim_vendor`, `dim_date`
* **Facts (3)**: `fact_sales`, `fact_purchases`, `fact_inventory`
* **Metrics (4)**: `customer_metrics`, `product_metrics`, `employee_performance`, `regional_analysis`
* **Executive KPIs (6)**: `kpi_sales`, `kpi_customers`, `kpi_products`, `kpi_employees`, `kpi_territories`, `kpi_inventory`

## SQL Design Decisions

* **Chained Dependencies**: The pipeline explicitly leverages the outputs of lower layers. Layer 4 queries Layer 3, never the raw tables. This ensures metrics are calculated once and reused everywhere.
* **Advanced SQL Utilization**:
  * **Window Functions**: `LAG()` is used in `kpi_sales` to calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) revenue growth.
  * **Ranking Functions**: `DENSE_RANK()` and `RANK()` dynamically generate Top 10 leaderboards for products, territories, and employees.
  * **Conditional Aggregation**: Used heavily to segment online vs. offline revenue directly within aggregation blocks.
  * **Chained CTEs**: Employed in `kpi_sales` and `kpi_territories` to structure multi-step mathematical calculations cleanly.
  * **CASE WHEN**: Extensively utilized for dynamic business categorization, such as bucketing customer lifetime value segments and triggering inventory health alerts.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Computed Columns Missing in Postgres**: During the initial CSV import, computed SQL Server columns like `LineTotal` and `StockedQty` were dropped by the `install.sql` script. This was resolved by manually reconstructing the mathematical logic (`ReceivedQty - RejectedQty`) directly within the Layer 2 `fact_sales` and `fact_purchases` views.
2. **Visualizing Deprecated Seaborn Palettes**: Encountered `FutureWarning` errors in the Jupyter Notebook due to Seaborn's recent update requiring a `hue` assignment for customized bar plots. This was quickly resolved by explicitly mapping the `x` variable to `hue` while disabling the legend.

## Assumptions Made

1. **Currency**: All monetary values are assumed to be standard USD.
2. **Date Boundaries**: The `dim_date` dimension was explicitly generated to cover dates from `2000-01-01` through `2030-12-31` to safely encompass all potential transactional data in the provided datasets without leaving gaps.
3. **Data Integrity**: We assumed that the imported CSV data contained complete header-to-detail relationships (no orphaned records during INNER JOINs).
