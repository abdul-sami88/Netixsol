# Week 3 Day 3 SQL Advanced: Aggregation, Subqueries, CTEs, and Window Functions

## SQL Concepts Explained

### Subqueries vs. CTEs vs. Window Functions

- Subquery: A query nested inside another query (e.g., inside SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or HAVING). Use a subquery for quick, one-off calculations that filter data (like finding a specific max value to compare against). Correlated subqueries are evaluated row-by-row against the outer query.
- CTE (Common Table Expression): Defined using the WITH clause, it acts as a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT statement. Use a CTE when a subquery becomes too complex, when you need to reference the same subquery multiple times, or to make your code much more readable by breaking it down into logical steps.
- Window Function: Performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row (e.g., using OVER(), PARTITION BY, ORDER BY). Unlike GROUP BY aggregation which collapses rows into a single summary row, window functions preserve the original rows while adding the calculated column. Use window functions for ranking, running totals, moving averages, and accessing previous/next rows (LAG/LEAD).

## Part 1: Aggregation Basics Solutions

1. Find the total revenue generated per store.

- Solution: Joined store to staff, and staff to payment. Grouped by store_id and used the SUM() aggregate function on amount. 

2. Find the average rental duration per film category.

- Solution: Joined category to film_category to film. Grouped by category and used ROUND(AVG(rental_duration), 2) to get clean decimal values.

3. Find the number of rentals made each month.

- Solution: Used TO_CHAR(rental_date, 'YYYY-MM') to extract the year and month from the rental timestamp. Grouped by this formatted date and counted rental_id.

4. Find categories with more than 50 films.

- Solution: Joined category to film_category, grouped by category, and used the HAVING clause to filter the results post-aggregation (HAVING COUNT(film_id) > 50).

## Part 2: Subquery Challenges Solutions

5. Find customers who spent more than the average customer spend.

- Solution: Calculated the total spent per customer, then used a HAVING clause containing a subquery that calculates the global average spend (SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)).

6. Find the film(s) with the highest rental rate in each category.

- Solution: Used a correlated subquery in the WHERE clause. For each row in the outer query, the subquery finds the maximum rental rate specifically for that row's category_id.

7. Find customers who have never rented a film.

- Solution: Used NOT EXISTS with a subquery checking the rental table for the outer query's customer_id. 

8. Find the store with the highest total revenue.

- Solution: Calculated the total revenue per store in a subquery in the FROM clause. Then, filtered it in the WHERE clause using another subquery to find the maximum revenue among all stores.

## Part 3: CTE & Window Function Challenges Solutions

9. Rank customers by total spend within each city.

- Solution: Used a CTE to calculate total spend per customer per city. In the main query, used RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY total_spent DESC) to reset the rank for each new city.

10. Most recently rented film for each customer.

- Solution: Created a CTE using ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY rental_date DESC). This gives the latest rental a row number of 1. The main query then filtered for WHERE rn = 1.

11. Month-over-month rental revenue growth.

- Solution: Created a CTE calculating total revenue per month. Used the LAG() window function to look at the previous month's revenue and calculated the percentage change.

12. Top 3 highest-grossing films per category.

- Solution: Built a chain of two CTEs. First CTE calculated total revenue per film per category. Second CTE ranked them using RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY category_name). Main query filtered for rank <= 3.

## Bonus Challenge Solution

Which staff member processed the highest revenue in each store, and what percentage of that store's total revenue did they contribute?

Solution:
    1. First CTE (StaffRevenue): Calculated total revenue processed by each staff member.
    2. Second CTE (StoreRevenue): Calculated the overall total revenue for each store.
    3. Third CTE (RankedStaff): Joined the first two CTEs together to calculate the percentage ((total_processed / store_total)  100). Applied RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY store_id) to rank the staff members.
    4. Main Query: Filtered for rank = 1 to get the top performer per store.

## Business Insights

1. Hyper-Localized VIP Marketing: Ranking customers by total spend within specific cities (and identifying above-average spenders) enables the marketing team to roll out highly targeted VIP loyalty programs or localized promotions in cities with dense clusters of high-value customers.
2. Inventory & Category Optimization: By identifying the highest-grossing films per category and analyzing average rental durations, management can optimize physical inventory—stocking more copies of high-grossing, fast-turnaround films to maximize availability and total revenue.
3. Staff Performance & Incentive Alignment: Tracking which staff members process the highest percentage of their store's total revenue (as seen in the Bonus Challenge) allows management to identify top performers. These insights can be used to develop targeted training programs or structure performance-based commission incentives.
